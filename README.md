# Grundy LLC

This is an MVP to showcase the Paystack payments API and in particular the Dynamic Split Payments.
This MVP emulates a storefront site called Grundy LLC.  It is an aggregator and recruits riders for delivery 
of items. Delivery fees are paid directly by Grundy LLC, and the funds are held, back and transfered 
to riders directly (this has not been implemented in the MVP).

The customer selects items from a consolidated storefront, and items are later split by partner/retailer, and
a dynamic split payment is used to effect the payment to each of the partner/retailers.
