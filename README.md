# Project notes

## to do:

- ~~add delivery charge to the basket~~
- ~~figure out which products belong to which~~ 
  - ~~store so we can do the payment~~
  - ~~I can fix that by including the info on the product (which is the right place)~~
- add payments
  - split payments because
    - pay delivery immediately
    - pay each merchant for their products in the basket
- redid the delivery partner
- store 
- and fixed up basket

## information I need
- how to setup a split payment
- how do I then process the split charge
